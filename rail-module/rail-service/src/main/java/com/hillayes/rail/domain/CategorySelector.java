/**
 * A category selector is a rule that is used to match transactions to a category.
 * Each category can have multiple selectors. Each of which is associated with an
 * account belonging to the user who owns the category.
 * <p>
 * Each selector has three optional fields that are used to match transactions:
 * infoContains, refContains and creditorContains. If a field is not specified, it
 * is ignored.
 * <p>
 * If specified, a transaction must contain the specified text in the corresponding
 * field to be matched. This results in an AND operation between the fields.
 * <p>
 * If the same account has multiple selectors for the same category, the transaction
 * must match at least one of the selectors to be matched to the category. Resulting
 * in an OR operation between the selectors.
