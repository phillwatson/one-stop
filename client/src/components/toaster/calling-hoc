To call a Higher-Order Component (HOC) method from a service class in a React application, you can use the following steps:

    Import the HOC component into the service class file:

javascript

import MyHOC from './MyHOC';

    Wrap the service class with the HOC:

javascript

const MyServiceWithHOC = MyHOC(MyService);

Here, MyService is the original service class that you want to wrap with the HOC. MyServiceWithHOC is the new service class that has the HOC applied to it.

    Create an instance of the new service class:

javascript

const myService = new MyServiceWithHOC();

    Call the HOC method on the instance of the new service class:

javascript

myService.myHOCMethod();

Here, myHOCMethod is the method defined in the HOC that you want to call.

By following these steps, you can call a HOC method from a service class in your React application.
